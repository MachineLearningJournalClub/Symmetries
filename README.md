## 1st Tutorial: Multiscale Representations and Wavelets

Taking inspiration from [Gabriel Peyre's Numerical Tours](https://github.com/gpeyre/numerical-tours)

In particular: 

* [Fourier & Wavelets](https://github.com/gpeyre/numerical-tours/blob/master/python/introduction_4_fourier_wavelets.ipynb) 
* [Image Denoising with Wavelets](https://github.com/gpeyre/numerical-tours/blob/master/python/denoisingwav_2_wavelet_2d.ipynb)

We can eventually try to re-implement some matlab code on specific wavelet families:
